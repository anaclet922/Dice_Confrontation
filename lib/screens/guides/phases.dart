          1. Preparation Phase.\n
Thirty seconds are allotted for this phase. There will be a dice roll cup, the current value of the bonuses, a ready button, and a dice value sum number.\n
You will see here and in other screens, the value of your opponent's selected dice and his current bonuses.\n
You need to roll the dice and determine which ones you will keep and which ones you will roll. You will also see your opponent's cubes and his readiness to start the game.\n
If you are sure of your dice choice, you can press the Ready button to show your opponent you have made your decision. But you won't be able to roll again.\n
If both players have used all their rolls or are ready for the next phase, they move on to it without waiting for time to run out.''',

The players are presented with the opponent's field in its entirety and can see exactly where the opponent's cubes are placed. Then it will be the turn of the first player.\n
